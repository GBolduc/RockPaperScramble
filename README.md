# RockPaperScramble


1)	Rock Paper Scramle is a web-based app that supports playing an interactive sprite game. The app supports directional movement of a sprite using keys as input. It also supports a temporary user login.
2)	The product is designed for one user playing against computer-generated sprites. Although many players may be playing at one time, players will not interact or be able to view one another. 
3)	We will store an all-time leaderboard based on sprite size.  The more prey a sprite successfully hunts, the larger the sprite gets.
4)	Rock Paper Scramble is a web-based interactive game.  A user controls a sprite using the arrow keys for directionality.  Sprites are able to "eat" other sprites in an arena based on their type (rock, paper or scissor). Sprites grow proportionally to the size of their conquered prey and adopt the prey's type as their own. Sprites can also eat smaller sprites of the same type. A player controls the directional movement of their sprite using the arrow keys as input, but are confined to the arena size. Sprites of the largest size are stored in the temporary leaderboard. All-time biggest sprites are stored in the All-time leaderboard available on the home-page.

6)	To further expand our project we could host the game on a server to allow simultaneous multiplayer access.  We could also allow users to create permanent profiles which would store their statistics.

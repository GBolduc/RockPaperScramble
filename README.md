# RockPaperScamble

Rock Paper Scramble is a web-based game.
Circles eat other circles in an arena based on their symbols (rock, paper or scissor). Circles grow and adopt their prey's symbol as they eat others. Circles can also eat circles of identical symbol if they are smaller. A player controls the directional movement of the circle.

# RockPaperScamble


1)	The app supports playing a game online. The app supports directional movement of a sprite using keys. It also supports a temporary login for the user.
2)	The product is for one user against the computer (for now). Although many players may be playing at one time. We are hoping to expand to multi-player.
3)	We will store an all-time leaderboard.
4)	Rock Paper Scramble is a web-based game.
Circles eat other circles in an arena based on their symbols (rock, paper or scissor). Circles grow and adopt their prey's symbol as they eat others. Circles can also eat circles of identical symbol if they are smaller. A player controls the directional movement of the circle. Circles of the greatest size are stored in the temporary Leaderboard. All-time biggest circles are stored in the All-time leaderboard.
